# FeedbackPrinter

A C# printer class and surrounding infrastructure used to print out the feedback from student's key marked pieces.

This library was built to be integrated into a system that simplifies the production of feedback for teachers, removing the need for more paperwork and allowing them to focus on providing said feedback.

It was also built to copy existing feedback documents almost exactly.
